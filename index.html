        Private Matches
        Fixed players not receiving updated lobby settings when finishing a previous Private Match

        Fixed players not showing up correctly in pre-match Team UI
        The Apex Legends servers have been experiencing frequent issues lately, and players are not happy with the
        current state of the game. Alongside the aforementioned teleporting, packet loss, and lag, players have also
        been encountering disconnects and errors. The most recent update also seems to have introduced additional bugs
        relating to certain Legends’ abilities, such as Wattson’s Pylons.

        The previous update was supposed to include the hotly-debated tap strafing nerf, but the change was delayed
        indefinitely due to unexpected side effects. With multiple issues popping up after the last patch, it seems like
        the tap strafing changes may be put on the backburner while Respawn tries to fix the glitches and server issues.
        If you’re able to play Apex despite the current issues, then the Evolution Collection Event is currently live
        in-game with a ton of new cosmetics to earn.

        <mark>Apex Legends is available now on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
