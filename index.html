        <h1 id="h11">twitch</h1>
        <p id="p1"> <b>twitch</b> is an American video live streaming service that focuses on video game live streaming,
            including
            broadcasts of esports competitions. In addition, it offers music broadcasts, creative content, and more
            recently, "in real life" streams. It is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc.
            It was introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform Justin.tv. Content
            on the site can be viewed either live or via video on demand.

            The popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of its general-interest counterpart. In October 2013, the website had
            45 million unique viewers, and by February 2014, it was considered the fourth largest source of peak
            Internet traffic in the United States. At the same time, Justin.tv's parent company was re-branded as Twitch
            Interactive to represent the shift in focus â€“ Justin.tv was shut down in August 2014. That month, the
            service was acquired by Amazon for US$970 million, which later led to the introduction of synergies
            with the company's subscription service Amazon Prime. Twitch acquired Curse in 2016, an operator of online
            video gaming communities and introduced means to purchase games through links on streams along with a
            program allowing streamers to receive commissions on the sales of games that they play.

            By 2015, Twitch had more than 100 million viewers per month. In 2017, Twitch remained the leading live
            streaming video service for video games in the US, and had an advantage over YouTube Gaming, which was shut
            down in 2018.As of February 2020, it had 3 million broadcasters monthly and 15 million daily active
            users, with 1.4 million average concurrent users.[10][11] As of May 2018, Twitch had over 27,000 partner
            channels.</p>
        <h1 id="h22">Youtube </h1>
        <p id="p2"><b>YouTube</b> is an American online video sharing and social media platform owned by Google. It was
            launched in
            February 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is the second most visited website, with more
            than one billion monthly users who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day.
            As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.

            In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion. Google's ownership of YouTube has also
            changed its business model; it no longer generates revenue from advertisements alone. YouTube now offers
            paid content such as movies and exclusive content. YouTube and approved creators participate in Google's
            AdSense program, which generates more revenue for both parties. It has since evolved from a small video
            streaming platform to a large service with reported revenues of $19.8 billion in 2020.

            Since its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the website into mobile apps, network television,
            and the ability to link with other services. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips,
            news, short films, feature films, documentaries, audio recordings, movie trailers, teasers, live streams,
            vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals. This includes collaborations between YouTubers
            and company sponsors. Since around 2015, established media corporations such as Disney, ViacomCBS, and
            WarnerMedia have created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a larger audience.

            YouTube has had a substantial social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating
            multimillionaire celebrities. It has been criticized for facilitating the spread of misinformation,
            copyright issues, violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, and endangering child safety and
            wellbeing.</p>
        <h1 id="h33">Netflix</h1>
        <p id="p3"><b>Netflix</b>, Inc. is an American pay television over-the-top media service and original programming
            production company. It offers subscription-based video on demand from a library of films and television
            series, 40% of which is Netflix original programming produced in-house. Netflix has also played a prominent
            role in independent film distribution. As of October 19, 2021, Netflix had 214 million subscribers,
            including 74 million in the United States and Canada, 70 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 39
            million in Latin America, and 30 million in Asia-Pacific. It is available worldwide except in
            mainland China (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to US sanctions). Netflix is
            a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).

            Netflix can be accessed via internet browser on computers, or via application software installed on smart
            TVs, set-top boxes connected to televisions, tablet computers, smartphones, digital media players, Blu-ray
            Disc players, video game consoles, and virtual reality headsets on the list of Netflix-compatible

            DVD and Blu-ray rentals delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional
            warehouses.

            Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. Netflix
            initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD
            rental business. In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming media/video on demand. The company expanded
            to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production
            industry in 2013, debuting its first series House of Cards. In January 2016, it expanded to an additional
            130 countries and then operated in 190 countries.

            The company is ranked 164th on the Fortune 500 and 284th on the Forbes Global 2000. It is the
            largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization. In 2021, Netflix was ranked as the 8th
            most trusted brand globally by Morning Consult.During the 2010s decade, Netflix was the top-performing
            stock in the S&P 500 stock market index, with a total return of 3,693%.

            Netflix is headquartered in Los Gatos, California, in Santa Clara County, with the two CEOs,
            Hastings and Ted Sarandos, split between Los Gatos and Los Angeles, respectively.[28][29] The company is
            seen as part of the Silicon Valley high-tech world.[30] It also operates international offices in Asia,
            Europe, and Latin America including in Canada, France, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Japan, South Korea,
            and the United Kingdom. The company has production hubs in Los Angeles, Albuquerque, London,
            Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto. Compared to other distributors, Netflix pays more for TV shows up front,
            but keeps more upside on big hits.</p>
